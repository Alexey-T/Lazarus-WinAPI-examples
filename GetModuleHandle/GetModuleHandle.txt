This example shows how to call GetModuleHandle to retrieve the load address of
modules in the process including the .exe itself.

It also serves as an example for ModifyMenu.  The items under the
"GetModuleHandle" menu change depending on the bitness of the program.  The
change is done using ModifyMenu.  Notice that the items in the menu are _not_
those declared in the .rc resource file and differ depending on the program's
bitness.

It can also serve as an example for the GetMenu and GetSubMenu APIs.  In order
to modify a specific menu item, first the handle to the menu must be obtained
using GetMenu and after that the handle to the popup menu associated with the
menu item must be obtained using GetSubMenu.  Once the submenu handle is known
then ModifyMenu can be called to modify an item in the popup menu.

API unrelated note.  The width and precision stated in the StrFmt function is
ignored by StrFmt if necessary (it is when the program is 64 bit.)
