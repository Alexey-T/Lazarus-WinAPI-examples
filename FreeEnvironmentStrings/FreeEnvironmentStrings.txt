This example calls the GetEnvironmentStrings API immediately followed by a
call to FreeEnvironmentStrings.

In Windows 9x the FreeEnvironmentStrings function does not free the
environment strings.  It verifies that the parameter passed does indeed point
to the process' environment strings.  If it does the function returns TRUE
otherwise it returns FALSE but it never frees the block.

In other versions of Windows, FreeEnvironmentStrings does free a memory block
that contains the environment strings.
