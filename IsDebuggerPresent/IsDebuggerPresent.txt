This example demonstrates how to use the API IsDebuggerPresent() to determine
if a program is running under a debugger or not.   If the program is
running under a debugger selecting "Break into the debugger" from the
IsDebuggerPresent() menu, will cause a break into the debugger, otherwise the
request to break into the debugger will be ignored.

It also demonstrates the difference between using DebugBreak() and an inline
int 3.  When using DebugBreak(), application debuggers will stop at the
DebugBreak() line because the _entire_ DebugBreak() procedure has _not_ yet
been executed, specifically, it stops at the "ret" that is inside DebugBreak().

When using an inline "int 3" the debugger will stop at the next source line
because the "int 3" has been fully executed unlike the DebugBreak() procedure.
