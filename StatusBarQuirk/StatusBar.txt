This example shows the use of the obsolete CreateStatusWindow API and a "quirk"
in the number of characters a status bar displays.   CreateWindow or
CreateWindowEx should be used instead of CreateStatusWindow.

The sample program attempts to display a string that is longer
than 137 characters in the status bar.  The string to be displayed consists
of a sentence that is repeated three times.  If the status bar does not
display the same sentence three times then truncation occurred.

To determine where the truncation took place, the text from the status bar
is retrieved using SB_GETTEXT and subsequently displayed in the listbox.  If
the listbox displays the sentence three times (as expected), it indicates
that the status bar did save the entire string but displayed only part of
it.

In spite of the fact that the status bar will only display 137 characters, it
does keep a full copy of the string that was sent to it using SB_SETTEXT.

Under build 950 of Windows 95 and, later versions as well, the status bar
control will not display more than 137 characters.  It is not known whether
this limit is intentional or not but, it does not seem to be documented
anywhere.
